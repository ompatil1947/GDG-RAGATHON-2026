# GDG RAGATHON 2026

 Build high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to solve real-world data challenges.(7th April - 9th April)
 
### Challenge Structure & Scoring
You are not limited to one challenge. To maximize your chances of winning, you can attempt multiple problem statements to stack your points.

| **Challenge**   | **Difficulty** | **Points** | **Objective**                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Statement 1** | **Easy**       | 20         | Decode and simplify complex insurance policies with high-precision RAG.        |
| **Statement 2** | **Medium**     | 40         | Build a local restaurant recommender using custom datasets and hybrid search.  |
| **Statement 3** | **Hard**       | 70         | Predict placement readiness using LLM data extraction and regression modeling. |

**How it works:**
- **Total Possible Score:** 130 Points.    
- **Flexibility:** You can choose to do just the Hard one, all three, or any combination.    
- **Winning Criteria:** The participant with the **highest cumulative points** at the end of 5 days wins.

> [!Note on Evaluation]
> If two participants both score 130 points, the winner will be decided based on **Code Quality** and **Full-stack Integration** (Frontend + Backend).

# *Problem Statements*

### Easy: The "Fine Print Decoder" (20 Points)

**Goal:** Build a RAG system that simplifies complex "Terms & Conditions" or Policy documents. You must use a comprehensive document (_Titan Secure Health Insurance Policy) to answer specific, high-stakes user queries with 100% accuracy.

- **The Task:** Create a bot that helps users understand complex legal jargon and hidden clauses in insurance or policy documents.
    
- **The Workflow:**
    
    1. **Context Loading:** The bot should ingest a set of 3–5 official documents (e.g., Health Insurance Policy, Credit Card Agreement, or Rental Contract).
        
    2. **Smart Filtering:** The user should be able to ask for clarifications based on "coverage," "penalties," or "exclusions" (e.g., _"Does this policy cover injuries from extreme sports?"_ or _"What is the penalty for early cancellation?"_).
        
    3. **Hybrid Knowledge:** The bot must use **RAG** to retrieve specific clauses (Section and Page references) and explain them in simple "ELI5" (Explain Like I'm Five) language.


#### Easy Bonus Credits (+5 Points)
- **Source Attribution:** Earn extra points if your bot explicitly cites the **Section and Clause number** for every answer it provides to ensure transparency and trust.

---
### Medium: The "Lucknow Foodie Guide" (40 Points)

**Goal:** Build a context-aware restaurant recommendation engine for the local area.
You must manually collect or scrape data for at least **20–30 local eateries** (e.g., _Tunday Kababi, Royal Cafe, Sky Glass Brewing, or the cafes in Phoenix Palassio_).

- **The Task:** Create a bot that helps students find the best places to eat around **IIIT Lucknow **.

- **The Workflow:** 
1. **Context Loading:** The bot should have access to a dataset of local Lucknow food spots (e.g., _Tunday Kababi, Royal Cafe, Sky Glass Brewing, or the cafes in Phoenix Palassio_).

2. **Smart Filtering:** The user should be able to ask for recommendations based on specific "vibe" or "budget" or based on dishes/reviews/Veg/Nonveg etc...(e.g., _"Suggest a budget-friendly Biryani place near campus"_ or _"Where can I find the best basket chaat in Gomti Nagar?"_).

3. **Hybrid Knowledge:** The bot must use **RAG** to retrieve restaurant details (hours, signature dishes) 

---
### Hard: The "Placement Predictor & Mentor" (70 Points)
**Goal:** A hybrid system combining **Generative AI** (for profile extraction) and **Regression** (for score prediction).
- **The Workflow:**
    
    1. **Chat-Based Profiling:** The student chats with the bot to provide their details (CGPA, Tech Stack, Projects, Internships, Communication, Opensource experience).
        
    2. **Structured Extraction:** An LLM extracts these values into a JSON format.
        
    3. **The Regression Engine:** These values are fed into a **Regression Model** (trained on senior placement data) to generate a **Readiness Score (0–100)**.
        
    4. **Experience RAG:** Based on the user's tech stack, the system retrieves the most relevant **Senior Interview Experiences** from a vector database.

### Bonus Credits (Go the Extra Mile)
Participants can earn a total of **50 additional points** by implementing these advanced features:

#### 1. The "Resume Parser" (+15 Points)
- **Challenge:** Instead of the student typing their details, allow them to **upload their Resume (PDF/Docx)**.
    
- **Requirement:** The system must autonomously extract the CGPA, Skills, and Experience directly from the file to feed the Regression model.


#### 2. "Smart Experience Matcher" (+30 Points)
- **Challenge:** Integrate a database of **Senior Interview Experiences**.
    
- **Requirement:** Use **Cosine Similarity** to compare the student's extracted profile against the interview database.
    
- **Result:** Recommend the top 3 most relevant interview experiences (e.g., if a student knows Java/AWS, show them Amazon or Goldman Sachs interview reports).

**"Anything more creative is most welcome and would receive an extra edge."**

We encourage you to go beyond the baseline requirements. Whether it’s an exceptionally intuitive **UI/UX**, a unique **Data Visualization** of the regression results, or an innovative **Prompt Engineering** technique, creativity will be highly rewarded during the final evaluation.

Good luck with RAGATHON
