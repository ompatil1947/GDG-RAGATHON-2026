## ⚖️ Submission Rules & Git Etiquette

1. **The 3-Member Rule:** All team members **must** have a visible commit history. Teams with zero-commit members will face disqualification.
    
2. **Atomic Commits:** Use descriptive, single-purpose commit messages (e.g., `feat: added chromaDB indexing for statement 1`).
    
3. **No Secrets:** Never commit `.env` files or API Keys. Use `.env.example` as a template.
    
4. **Detailed READMEs:** Each statement folder must have a README documenting your **Architecture**, **Tech Stack**, and **Bonus Attempts**.
    

### 🏷️ Pull Request (PR) Title Format

`[SUBMISSION] TeamName - Statements [1,2,3] + [BONUS: FeatureName]`

Example:
`[SUBMISSION] Team-Alpha - Statements [1,3] + [BONUS: Resume-Parser, Smart-Matcher]`


### 🏁 Final Submission Step

Once you have created your Pull Request on GitHub, you **must** submit the URL of that PR in the **Official Google Form** shared in the event group.

> [!CAUTION] **Submissions without a corresponding Google Form entry will not be evaluated.**
